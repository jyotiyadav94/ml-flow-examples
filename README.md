# MLflow Project: Wine Quality Prediction

This project demonstrates a basic example of using MLflow to track machine learning experiments with a dataset on wine quality. The dataset used in this example is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

## Dataset

The dataset consists of physicochemical properties of wine, and the goal is to predict the wine quality. For more details on the dataset, refer to:

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `mlflow`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn mlflow
